ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is a simple pythonic implementation of a Marks Recording System
where the user will enter his/her details and his/her marks. The details given will be saved
as a text file in a directory. The user also has the option to view the pie chart of his/her
marks.

THE PROJECT CONTAINS TWO FILES AND TWO DIRECTORIES

MARKS RECORDING SYSTEM
    |- Students   [DIRECTORY | AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED WHEN YOU WILL RUN THE PROJECT FOR THE FIRST TIME]
    |- Marks.py   [Python File]
    |- RunMarksRecorder.py    [Python File]
    |- __Pycache__   [DIRECTORY | CACHE DATA AUTOMATICALLY CREATED BY THE PYTHON INTERPRETER]
    |- Readme.txt    [TEXT DOCUMENT | README FILE]


The Students Directory is the place where the Mark Details of the Students
will be saved

The Marks.py is the File where all the coding stuff is written. I've not
compiled this file so that people can view the source code

The RunMarksRecorder.py is the place from where you'll run the marks recording
system.

[Note -> Make Sure that you have installed the Matplotlib via pip. Otherwise
you will see a "ModuleNotFoundError" when you will run this file.]
