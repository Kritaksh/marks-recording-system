ABOUT THE PROJECT

THE PROJECT CONTAINS TWO FILES AND TWO DIRECTORIES

MARKS RECORDING SYSTEM
    |- Students   [DIRECTORY]
    |- Marks.py   [Python File]
    |- RunMarksRecorder.exe    [Executable File]
    |- __Pycache__   [DIRECTORY | CACHE DATA CREATED BY THE PYTHON INTERPRETER]


The Students Directory is the place where the Mark Details of the Students
will be saved

The Marks.py is the File where all the coding stuff is written. I've not
compiled this file so that people can view the source code

The RunMarksRecorder.py is the place from where you'll run the marks recording
system.
